Code for the "Custom Liquid/HTML" blocks in the theme editor is located in the /custom_liquid folder. 

The /dev folder is just misc. stuff I used for references or testing things.

The recharge_widget.liquid file is just to handle hiding the old "plan" buttons while still using other parts of the app, like the subscription details/one-time purchase components as well as the rx information modal.

The ah_widget.liquid file is all of the code related to generating and updating the "Get Started" button's href.
